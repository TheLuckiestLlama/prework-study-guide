# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

My motivation was to help me re-learn some programming skills. I made this study guide as a means of hands on learning, and somewhere to store the information I learned. Now I have my coding knowledge refreshed and somewhere to study. I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript.


## Installation

As my study guide is a webpage, you just need to install Google Chrome or another browser to view it.

## Usage

Right click on the webpage, then select inspect element. Click on the "console" tab to view the suggestion for what topic to study.

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.
